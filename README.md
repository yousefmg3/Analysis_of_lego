# Analysis_of_lego

This paper analyses how Lego sets, and prices have evolved since the 1950s. Lego sets have become more colourful
and Lego has collaborated with many companies to create sets of things people love. While the average size of a Lego set has
increased, so have the prices, with a lot more sets being considered overpriced in the 2010s compared to the 1950s. The number of
pieces a set has is the factor that influences price the most, challenging sets are also more expensive than easier ones. Predictive
models were built to help us understand how Lego decides on prices of sets.
